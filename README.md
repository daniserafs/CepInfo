Create an API to search CEP (Brazilian Zip Code/Postal Code). Consume the API and show data to user.✅
Input: Zip Code using strings with hyphens.✅ (❓ I'm not quite sure if the code at this point is able to accept hyphens.)
Requirements: Use Axios, desctrutings and other ES6+ resources. ✅
Use http modules from nodeJS. ✅


### Initializing
    on terminal: `yarn start`
    will start both server and client

### Some thoughts
    - this is a simple project to develope my skills on back-end and front-end applications
    - any feedback is helpful!
    - I installed express and cors via yarn. Cors is going to help establish communication between the front-end and back-end. I'm not sure I'll be needing that but it seems important. 
    - `useState` is still something blurring in my mind
